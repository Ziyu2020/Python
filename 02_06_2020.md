```python
super().
```

### In single inheritance
`super()` allows to call methods of superclass in subclass. `super()` returns a delegate object to a parent class, so you call the method you want directly on it: super().area().

### The parameters of `super()`
`super()` can take two parameters: the first is the subclass, and the second parameter is an object that is an instance of that subclass.

```python
class Rectanguar():
    def __init___(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
    
    def area(self):
        area = self.width * self.length
        return area
    
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * ( self.width + self.length )

class Square(Rectangular):
    def __init__(self, length):
        super(Square, self).__init__(self, length)
```

Here we could see 2 parameters of `super(Square, self)`, the first one refers to the subclass itself, while the secong one refers to the object of this _subclass Square_.

### In multiple inhertance
Python supports multiple inheritance, in which a subclass can inherit from multiple superclasses that donâ€™t necessarily inherit from each other (also known as sibling classes).

```python
class Triangle():
    def __init__(self, base, height):
        self.base = base 
        self.height = height
        
    def area(self):
        return 0.5 * base * height 
        
 class Rightpyramid(Triangle, Square):
    def __init__(self, base, slant_height):
        self.base = base
        self.slant_height = slant_height
        super().__init__(self. base)
    
    def area(self):
        base_area = super.area()
        perimeter = super.perimter()
        return 0.5 * perimeter * self.slant_height + base_area
```

**super().__init__(self. base)** initializes partially from `Square`, so the `base` could be recalculated as class `Square`.
